# Blockchain Implementation Summary

## âœ… Requirements Fulfillment

This implementation successfully fulfills all the requirements specified in the `instructions/requirements.md` file.

### 1. âœ… Digital Signature of Transactions using ECDSA

**Implemented in:** `pkg/wallet/wallet.go`, `pkg/blockchain/transaction.go`

- **ECDSA Key Pairs**: Each user (Alice, Bob) has their own ECDSA key pair using the P256 curve
- **Transaction Structure**: Includes sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, and signature
- **Signature Generation**: Uses `crypto/ecdsa` with proper R and S padding (32 bytes each)
- **Signature Verification**: Validates transactions before including in blocks
- **Address Generation**: SHA256 hash of public key (first 20 bytes, similar to Ethereum)

**Key Features:**
- Secure ECDSA P256 curve implementation
- 64-byte signatures (32 bytes R + 32 bytes S)
- Automatic signature verification
- Wallet persistence in JSON format

### 2. âœ… Data Storage on LevelDB, Validation with Merkle Tree

**Implemented in:** `pkg/storage/leveldb.go`, `pkg/blockchain/merkle.go`, `pkg/blockchain/block.go`

- **LevelDB Storage**: Persistent storage for blocks, transactions, and blockchain state
- **Merkle Tree**: Binary tree construction for transaction integrity verification
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, transactions, Merkle root, previous hash, current hash
- **Chain Validation**: Complete blockchain integrity verification

**Key Features:**
- Efficient LevelDB key-value storage
- Automatic Merkle root calculation
- Block-by-index and block-by-hash retrieval
- Pending transaction management
- Chain validation with integrity checks

### 3. âœ… Consensus Mechanism among 3 Validator Nodes (Docker)

**Implemented in:** `pkg/consensus/consensus.go`, `cmd/node/main.go`, `docker-compose.yml`

- **3 Validator Nodes**: Configured in Docker Compose (node1, node2, node3)
- **Leader-Follower Model**: Node1 is leader, node2 and node3 are followers
- **Voting Mechanism**: 2/3 majority consensus (2 out of 3 nodes)
- **Block Proposal**: Leader creates blocks from pending transactions
- **Consensus Protocol**: Followers validate and vote on proposed blocks

**Key Features:**
- Configurable leader election
- Automatic block production (5-second intervals)
- Majority voting consensus
- Consensus timeout handling
- State management (Leader/Follower/Syncing)

### 4. âœ… Node Validator Recovery Mechanism upon Disconnection

**Implemented in:** `pkg/consensus/consensus.go`, `cmd/node/main.go`

- **State Management**: Nodes can transition between operational and syncing states
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic peer discovery and reconnection
- **Block Synchronization**: Ability to catch up with missed blocks
- **Recovery Protocol**: Nodes resume participation after synchronization

**Key Features:**
- Graceful node shutdown and restart
- State persistence across restarts
- Automatic synchronization on reconnection
- Fault-tolerant consensus mechanism
